# bikesharing

## Overview
The purpose of this analysis is to review the bikesharing data to convince investors that a bike-sharing program is a solid business proposal for Des Moines. In this analysis, we are looking at the lengths of times that the bikes are checked out for all riders and genders, the number of bike trips for all riders and genders for each hour of each day of the week, and the number of bike trips for each type of user and gender for each day of the week.

## Summary
Overall, the results of these visualizations show that the bikesharing program is quite successful especially among male users. There are quite a few riders using the program at any given time of day with peak times of use being typically during most weekdays around 5 and 6 pm. In addition to the analysis we have performed with the given dataset, I would also find it interesting to analyze the locations that are most often frequented by customers specifically broken down by gender and time as well as what the most common length of each trip is for all customers.
